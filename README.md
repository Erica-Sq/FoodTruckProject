# FoodTruckProject

# Overview/Description
		 This program allows user input on a variety of characteristics of foodtrucks, then is able to compile the input and provide a processed display.

		 In order to use this software, a user must input the name, food type, and rating of a food truck. Once the user inputs all the information they would like to process, the program returns a menu. From this menu, the user is asked whether they would like to see a list of the food trucks, the average rating of food trucks, the highest rated food truck, or to end the program.  

		 This program utilizes object initiation, toStrings, and encapsulation amongst others.
# Technologies Used
		Java, OOP, Eclipse

# Lessons Learned
		I was able to utilize the TA hours after class to reproduce this project, after my first attempt. I was also able to recognize the patterns in the code to decipher when methods needed to be used and why.
