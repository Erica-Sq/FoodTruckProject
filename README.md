# Lessons Learned

I attended the tutoring hours on Saturday. I thought I had the program down, and then I got confused and lost along the way. I was embarrassed to ask for help until it was too late. I then was unable to get back on track. My greatest lesson learned wa that I need to just reach out for help. I know I could've completed this project if i had simply asked for help. I will be asking for help a lot more frequently.
